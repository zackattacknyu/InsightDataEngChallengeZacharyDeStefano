# InsightDataEngChallengeZacharyDeStefano

This is my submission for the Insight Data Engineering Challenge

The file run.sh successfully parses through the two log files in log_input directory
	and then creates a flagged purchases file in the log_output directory
	
The file run_myUnitTests.sh runs the informal unit tests I wrote as I developed 
	the code. It does not run JUnit. With more time I would have run formal JUnit tests
	but for this challenge I just manually checked the output. 
	
**TO UPDATE** 
When I run bash, I am having issues getting run_tests.sh to complete successfully
	mainly because it refuses to run the jar file
